# Star-Wars-Turing-Game
A one player game based on the Star Wars Universe.

# Try it yourself!
To run the game, download the folder "Star Wars Turing Game," and then run the file 'Star Wars Game.exe'.

# To access the source code
Download and install a version of Turing from http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/ OR a version of Open Turing from http://tristan.hume.ca/openturing/.

Access the folder Source Files and open the Turing file titled 'Star Wars Game.t'.

# How it works
This game was developed solely with loops, event handlers, and sprites.

# Challenges I ran into
I must note that this game runs on approximately 2800 lines of code and this happened because during the time I did not really understand neither knew what functions were and how to implement them, hence the mess that this game is. This got to the point where the code would not compile on my school compilers for testing purposes.

# Why I made it
The inspiration for this game came from a summative project for my school's computer class in grade 10. However, I went a project that surpassed every expectation from a grade 10 computer science class.
